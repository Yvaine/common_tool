Boost Mutex Examples
====================

By Gavin Baker <gavinb@antonym.org>

Provides fully working examples of different types of mutexes using the
Boost thread module.

duel
----

Two threads both try to modify the same counter, one up and one down.  No
mutex is used to protect the counter.

trylock
-------

Instead of blocking to acquire the mutex, this example shows how to take
alternative action if the mutex is already held.

timedlock
---------

Shows how to use a timeout to acquire a mutex, so it will not block
indefinitely.

reclock
-------

Illustrates how a recursive lock can be used when two methods may be called
with or without the mutex held, and one calls the other.

deadlock
--------

Two threads access two mutexes protecting some shared resource, but they
lock in a different order.  After enough iterations, they will eventually
deadlock.

common
------

In order to keep the code as short and focused as possible, utility
functions are grouped into a common module.  This provides features such as
logging and random delays which are used by all examples.


tests
-----

All the programs produce structured output. That is, they write to stdout in
a known line format, which can later be analysed for statistics.  I use
GNU R (http://www.r-project.org/) for the analysis, which is also how the
data plots were produced for the articles.
